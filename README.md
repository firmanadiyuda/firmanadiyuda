## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can call me **Firman Adiyuda**. Since junior high school, I have loved and been involved in IT and Multimedia fields such as Programming, Graphic Design, and Videography. Becoming a competent person in the area of interest that I mentioned above is a dream that I must achieve.

I'm good at Laravel Framework, Bootstrap, Tailwind, HTML, and CSS. I can also operate multimedia software such as Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator and CorelDraw.
