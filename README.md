### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Firman Adiyuda**. I was born in Jakarta, January 25, 2000. Since junior high school, I have loved and been involved in IT and Multimedia fields such as Web Design & Development, Graphic Design, Videography, and Music Composing. Becoming a competent person in the area of interest that I mentioned above is a dream that I must achieve.
